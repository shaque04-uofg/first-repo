  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>A software I found exceptionally well-designed and interactive is Microsoft OneNote. As a first-year student, note-taking is one of, if not the most crucial elements on the path to academic success. Lecture notes, reminders, pointers from professors, and every other significant piece of information absorbed find their respective places in my notes; Microsoft OneNote is the platform that I've been using to do so. After purchasing a laptop with a stylus and a severe bore from old-fashioned pen and paper note-taking, I searched for an interactive, efficient, intuitive software that reduces the clutter and exhaustion of regular note-taking. After extensive research, trial and error, and about 20 uninstalled software later, I realized I never paid attention to the software already part of my computer. Fast forward a month in university, and survival without Microsoft OneNote seems impossible. Quick stylus changes, real-time media attachment, multi-device syncing; the list is endless. Software as well-designed as OneNote is life-changing, especially when the entirety of our submissions, assignments and related coursework, is done electronically.</p>
  <p>The interface and design of Microsoft OneNote are evidence of the significance of software design. Well-designed software guarantees usability, efficiency, and a positive user experience. Well-designed software allows users to complete tasks with minimal frustration through thoughtful design that is adaptable and accessible, ensuring any user can personally interact with the software to their preferences. This attention to detail and inclusivity is the reason excellent software such as OneNote become a necessity for users. Satisfaction and loyalty are the key reasons for the success of software; the success of software is unattainable without an exceptional design and a tailored interface that is personal for each user.

  <h1>Writing Assignment 2</h1>
  <p>The software development lifecycle comprises four major phases: the software requirements gathering phase is the first phase consisting of the main requirements of stakeholders, including administrators, end users, and the development team. Here, developers consistently communicate with stakeholders to help developers understand the softwareâ€™s functionality and features according to the needs and expectations of stakeholders. This phase absorbs the inputs of all stakeholders first and then merges them into a meaningful foundation for the project. A requirements gathering phase not only defines the scope and range of the potential software but also minimizes the possibility of costly mistakes and misunderstandings during development and post-development. These requirements are always well defined so the software fulfils its purposes and satisfies stakeholders. Knowing exactly what the users want, need and expect from the software, helps the development team to better prioritize features, create a realistic project timeframe, and finally design an efficient and user-friendly system. In the case of Microsoft OneNote, the desire is for a feature like note-taking, cloud sync, collaboration tools, and integration with Microsoft 365 in the rest of its product line. If we capture requirements early, we save time and money and align the development process with the established goals.</p>
  <p>Here are five user stories for Microsoft OneNote:</p>
  <p>1. As a student, I want to organize my notes into separate notebooks, so that I can easily access different subjects.</p>
  <p>2. As a teacher, I want to share my notebooks with students, so that I can distribute learning materials efficiently.</p>
  <p>3. As a business professional, I want to integrate OneNote with other Microsoft 365 apps, so that I can streamline my workflow.</p>
  <p>4. As a team leader, I want to assign tags to specific sections of my notes, so that I can prioritize tasks easily.</p>
  <p>5. As a remote worker, I want to collaborate on a notebook in real-time, so that I can work with my team on projects seamlessly.</p>
